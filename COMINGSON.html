                        <font size="1" style="color:white;">The shiniest of hidden gems, "A Silent Voice" is about a boy named Shoya (Miyu Irino) who quickly begins to tease Shoko (Saori Hayami) — a deaf transfer student — which encourages most of their classmates to join in. However, when Shoko's mother confronts the school about her daughter being bullied, Shoya is thrown under the bus and becomes the scapegoat for all of the torment that Shoko has received. Things get even worse after Shoko moves on to a different school, as the student body continues to shun Shoya in lieu of taking any responsibility for their own cruelty.</font><br>

Not only is it Makoto Shinkai's best movie, and one of the best anime movies of all time, but it's one of the biggest movies in Japanese history, making more than $357 million at the box office.</font><br>

                        <font size="1" style="color:white;">Perhaps inspired by "The Garden of Words," Makoto Shinkai revisits a budding love story during a rainy season in "Weathering with You." It focuses on a runaway named Hodaka (Kotaro Daigo) and an orphan girl named Hina (Nana Mori), both struggling with the seemingly never-ending rains that have been drenching Tokyo. After Hodaka helps Hina out of a dangerous situation, the two decide to run away together.</font><br>
